# Punt Labs

Small-scale artisanal software. Open source. Quality-focused.

## About

Punt Labs builds thoughtfully crafted software across diverse domains. Our name comes from punting in Oxford—a casual way to give something a go.

## Projects

- [Koch Trainer](https://github.com/punt-labs/koch-trainer-swift) — iOS app for learning Morse code using the Koch method. Features receive/send training, QSO simulation with virtual stations, spaced repetition scheduling, and vocabulary practice for amateur radio operators.

## Philosophy

We believe good software emerges from care and attention. Each project receives the focus it deserves.
