# Punt Labs

Open source tools for software engineering teams using AI.

## About

Decades of computer science and software engineering research — structured product discovery, test-driven development, formal methods, and behavior-preserving transformations — have always worked. They were just challenging to apply consistently under pressure. We believe AI changes that equation. We build open source CLI tools, Claude Code plugins, and MCP servers to find out.

Our design standards and project guide live in [punt-kit](https://github.com/punt-labs/punt-kit). Our [tenets](https://www.punt-labs.com/about#tenets) document where we think agentic coding is heading.

## Projects

### Grounding & Formal Methods

- [**PR/FAQ**](https://github.com/punt-labs/prfaq) `Claude Code` — Structured product discovery using Amazon's Working Backwards process. Eight specialized agents, simulated review meetings, compiled PDF output. Grounding for *what* to build.
- **Use Cases** — Guided use-case specification using Jacobson-Cockburn Use-Case Foundation v1.1. In development.
- [**Z Spec**](https://github.com/punt-labs/z-spec) `Claude Code` — Formal Z specifications for stateful systems. Extract specs from existing code (`code2model`) or generate code from specs (`model2code`). Type-check with fuzz, animate and model-check with ProB. Grounding for *how* to build it.
- **Refactory** — Deterministic, behavior-preserving refactoring. The AI decides what needs restructuring, Refactory executes on a parsed program model with formally defined preconditions. Built on Opdyke's original definition. In development.
- **ReasonTrace** — Session recordings as engineering assets. Captures every AI coding session as a dual-stream recording (terminal for humans, structured events for agents), extracts reasoning decisions, and runs automated review agents against project standards and formal specs. Agents reviewing agents. In development.

### Building Blocks

- [**Quarry**](https://github.com/punt-labs/quarry) `CLI` `Claude Code` `Claude Desktop` `macOS` — Local semantic search across your documents. 30+ formats, AST-level code parsing, offline. Works as a standalone CLI, an MCP server, or through the [menu bar app](https://github.com/punt-labs/quarry-menubar).
- [**Beadle**](https://github.com/punt-labs/beadle) `MCP` `Go` — Email communication over Proton Bridge with a four-level PGP trust model. Written in Go.
- [**Biff**](https://github.com/punt-labs/biff) `CLI` `Claude Code` — Team communication resurrecting BSD Unix vocabulary (`who`, `finger`, `write`, `plan`) over a NATS relay. Humans and agents show up side by side. Serious coordination, retro charm.
- [**Vox**](https://github.com/punt-labs/vox) `CLI` `Claude Code` — Text-to-speech engine with multi-provider support (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, AWS Polly). Spoken notifications, chimes, and arbitrary speech synthesis. Opt-in only.
- [**Ethos**](https://github.com/punt-labs/ethos) `CLI` `Claude Code` `Go` — Identity and workflow for human-agent teams. Persistent identity (personality, writing style, roles, team structure) loads automatically every session. Typed mission contracts for structured delegation with write-set boundaries, bounded rounds, and audit trails. Three integration surfaces (filesystem, CLI, MCP) — any tool reads identity state without taking a dependency.
- [**Lux**](https://github.com/punt-labs/lux) `CLI` `Claude Code` — A visual output surface for AI agents. ImGui display server connected by Unix socket IPC — agents send JSON element trees, the display renders them at 60fps. 22 element kinds, interactive controls, incremental updates, render functions with consent.
- **Tally** — Token consumption, model usage, and spend tracking across sessions and projects. In development.
- [**punt-kit**](https://github.com/punt-labs/punt-kit) `CLI` `Python` — Org standards, shared tooling, and project scaffolding. The `punt` CLI.

### Test Bed

Real projects where we discover what works and what doesn't.

- [**Koch Trainer**](https://github.com/punt-labs/koch-trainer-swift) `iOS` — Morse code trainer using the Koch method. Built from a formal [Z Spec](https://github.com/punt-labs/z-spec) specification — the design-to-code workflow in action.
- [**langlearn-tts**](https://github.com/punt-labs/langlearn-tts) `Claude Desktop` — An AI language tutor that speaks to you. 28 tutor personas across 7 languages and 4 levels. Built on [Vox](https://github.com/punt-labs/vox).
- [**LangLearn**](https://github.com/punt-labs/langlearn) — The complete platform wiring langlearn-tts, [langlearn-anki](https://github.com/punt-labs/langlearn-anki), and [langlearn-imagegen](https://github.com/punt-labs/langlearn-imagegen) into one pipeline. In development.
- [**Dungeon**](https://github.com/punt-labs/dungeon) `Claude Code` — Text adventure where Claude is the game master. No code runs, only prompts. Built to experiment with UX concepts for Claude Code experiences.
