{"id":".github-jay","title":"Add dev workflow standards and project scaffolding tool","description":"DESIGN-GUIDANCE.md needs a dev workflow section based on Biff's CLAUDE.md patterns: workflow tiers (Forge/Feature Dev/Direct), branch discipline (feat/fix/refactor/docs prefixes), micro-commits, conventional commit messages, quality gates before every commit, pre-PR checklist, code review flow (Copilot review before merge), session close protocol, and design decision logs. Beyond documentation, this repo should become the scaffolding tool ('punt init' or similar) that bootstraps new projects with: templated CLAUDE.md, beads init, quality gate config (ruff/mypy/pytest), CI workflows, pyproject.toml or plugin.json skeleton, and correct naming conventions. Dependencies: feature-dev, claude-flow, feature-forge as workflow tools.
